    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Tonkotsu ramen </strong>(豚骨ラーメン) is a ramen dish that
      originated in Fukuoka, Fukuoka Prefecture on the Kyushu island of Japan,
      and it is a speciality dish in both Fukuoka and Kyushu. The soup broth is
      based on pork bones and other ingredients, which are typically boiled for
      several hours, and the dish is traditionally topped with sliced pork belly
      and served with ramen noodles that are hard in the center. In Fukuoka,
      Japan, tonkotsu ramen is referred to as <strong>Hakata ramen</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The traditional preparation method for the ramen noodles used in tonkotsu
      ramen is for the noodles to be hard in the center. Some ramen shops allow
      customers to select the level of firmness for the noodles, including
      <em>futsu</em> for regular or standard, <em>barigane</em> for very hard,
      <em>barikata</em> for al dente and <em>yawamen</em> for soft. Some
      restaurants also provide a second order of noodles if requested by the
      customer, in a system referred to as <em>kaedama.</em>

    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>2 slices bacon – use good quality bacon here</li>
      <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp mirin</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp sake</li>
      <li>4 Tbsp shiro miso</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Miso Tare</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup shiro miso</li>
      <li>1/4 cup sake</li>
      <li>1/4 cup mirin</li>
      <li>pinch shichimi togarashi (optional)</li>
      <li>1-2 tsp kosher salt – depending on how salty you like your ramen</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Chashu pork belly</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine the soy, sake, mirin, sugar, garlic and green onions in a ziploc
        bag large enough to hold the pork belly. Stick a straw in the bag and
        seal the ziploc bag up against it (so the straw is the only opening).
        Suck as much of the air out as you can and seal.
      </li>
      <li>Sous vide the pork for 10-11 hours at 170F.</li>
      <li>Remove pork from the ziploc bag. Discard the bag and marinade.</li>
      <li>Let the chashu pork belly cool completely.</li>
      <li>
        Slice across the chashu pork (so you get bacon like slices) – into 8-12
        slices about 1/8 to 3/16 inches thick. Reserve. You won’t need all the
        pork for 4 servings.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Soy bacon tare</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine all the ingredients in a small sauce pan. Simmer at the lowest
        setting for about an hour. Top up with a bit of chicken stock if needed.
      </li>
      <li>Remove the bacon.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Miso tare</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine all ingredients in a small sauce pan and simmer at the lowest
        setting for about 5 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Medium boiled eggs</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring enough water to cover the eggs to a boil. If you have a way to
        prick the eggshell do it. Boil large eggs for 6 minutes 30 seconds. If
        using extra large eggs boil them for 7 minutes 30 seconds. You may have
        to adjust your times slightly depending on the exact size of your eggs
        but this should get you pretty close.
      </li>
      <li>
        Submerge the eggs in cold or ice water to chill. This stops the egg
        yolks from continuing to set up. Peel. Cut in half right before you
        serve your tonkotsu ramen.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Assemble the tonkotsu ramen</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Boil the ramen noodles in plenty of water as directed by the packaging.
        If there’s no translation on the packaging usually its 4 minutes. You
        don’t need to salt the water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the mushrooms along side the noodles – you just want them softened.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently fry the chashu pork in a non-stick skillet until lightly browned.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place 1/4 of whichever tare you are using in the bottom of four bowls.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ladle in about 1/2 cup of the tonkotsu broth into each of the bowls and
        stir to mix.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the noodles. Pour in another 1 1/2 cups of the tonkotsu broth per
        bowl.
      </li>
      <li>Top with the egg, mushrooms, pork and green onions.</li>
    </ol>
