    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      New Yorkâ€“style pizza is pizza made with a characteristically large
      hand-tossed thin crust, often sold in wide slices to go. The crust is
      thick and crisp only along its edge, yet soft, thin, and pliable enough
      beneath its toppings to be folded in half to eat. Traditional toppings are
      simply tomato sauce and shredded mozzarella cheese.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
      <li>2/3 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 (10 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
      <li>1 pound shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 cup grated Romano cheese</li>
      <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh basil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Sprinkle the yeast over the surface of the warm water in a large bowl.
        Let stand for 1 minute, then stir to dissolve. Mix in the flour, salt
        and olive oil. When the dough is too thick to stir, turn out onto a
        floured surface, and knead for 5 minutes. Knead in a little more flour
        if the dough is too sticky. Place into an oiled bowl, cover, and set
        aside in a warm place to rise until doubled in bulk.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). If using a pizza
        stone, preheat it in the oven as well, setting it on the lowest shelf.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the dough has risen, flatten it out on a lightly floured surface.
        Roll or stretch out into a 12 inch circle, and place on a baking pan. If
        you are using a pizza stone, you may place it on a piece of parchment
        while preheating the stone in the oven.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the dough. Sprinkle with oregano,
        mozzarella cheese, basil, Romano cheese and red pepper flakes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until the bottom of the
        crust is browned when you lift up the edge a little, and cheese is
        melted and bubbly. Cool for about 5 minutes before slicing and serving.
